## Project Overview & Flow

### 1. **Face Verification**

- **Landing Page:** The user is prompted to upload a photo ID (image file).
- **Reference Image:** The uploaded image is stored and used as the reference for face verification.
- **Live Verification:** The user is redirected to a webcam page. The app captures frames and compares the live face to the reference image using FaceNet and MTCNN.
- **Access Control:** Only if the face matches, the user can proceed to the interview. Otherwise, options for retry or manual verification are provided.

### 2. **Document Upload & Interview Setup**

- **Form Inputs:** The user selects:
  - Country
  - Board (e.g., CBSE, IB)
  - Grade (Primary, Secondary, Higher Secondary)
  - Subject (populated based on grade)
- **File Uploads:** The user uploads:
  - Job Description (JD) file (`.txt`, `.doc`, `.docx`, `.pdf`)
  - Resume file (`.txt`, `.doc`, `.docx`, `.pdf`)
- **Validation:** The backend checks file types and required fields.

### 3. **Interview Initialization**

- **Key Extraction:** The backend uses OpenAI to extract key points from the JD and generate a subject syllabus.
- **Topic Allocation:** The system determines 2-3 main interview topics and allocates time for each (total 4 minutes).
- **Demo Questions:** Example questions are generated for context.
- **Session State:** All selections and extracted data are stored in the session.

### 4. **Interview Process**

- **Video Recording:** The user's webcam and microphone are activated. Video is chunked and uploaded to the server.
- **Question Flow:**
  - The interview starts with an introduction prompt.
  - For each topic, the system generates questions using OpenAI, considering the JD, syllabus, and candidate's background.
  - Each question is spoken aloud (TTS) and displayed.
  - After a countdown, the user's audio answer is recorded and uploaded in chunks.
  - The answer is transcribed using Whisper.
  - The system evaluates the answer (clarity, relevance, depth, examples) and scores it.
  - A connecting sentence is spoken, and the next question is generated.
- **Topic Progression:** After the allocated number of questions per topic, the interview moves to the next topic.
- **Completion:** After all topics/questions, the interview ends.

### 5. **Post-Interview & Evaluation**

- **Summary:** The system calculates topic-wise average scores and generates a comprehensive evaluation using OpenAI, including:
  - Key strengths and weaknesses
  - Final recommendation (Shortlisted, On Hold, Rejected)
  - Justification based on answers, resume, and introduction
- **Results Display:** The UI shows:
  - All questions and candidate answers with scores
  - Topic-wise averages
  - Evaluation summary and recommendation

3. **Interview Setup:**  
   - Fill out the form: select country, board, grade, subject.
   - Upload your JD and resume.
   - Click "Start Interview".
4. **Interview:**  
   - The system will ask questions (audio + text).
   - Listen, then answer aloud after the countdown.
   - Your answers are recorded and transcribed.
   - The process repeats for all topics/questions.
5. **Results:**  
   - After the interview, view your answers, scores, and the AI-generated summary.
